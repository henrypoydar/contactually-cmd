# Contactually / Command Line

Provides command line access to http://www.Contactually.com CRM data. The Contactually UI does not have an upcoming task list (or any general task list). However I love the Gmail and contact sync so I need to make do. Here's a quick and dirty way to get a list of tasks.

## Installation

1.) Put your API key in `~/.contactually`

2.) Install the gem:

    $ gem install contactually

## Usage

    $ contactually -h

## Contributing

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/[my-github-username]/contactually/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
