# Contactually / Command Line

Provides command line access to http://www.Contactually.com CRM data. The Contactually UI does not have an upcoming task list (or any general task list). However I love the Gmail and contact sync so I need to make do. Here's a quick and dirty way to get a list of tasks.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'contactually'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install contactually
